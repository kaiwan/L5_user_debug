/*
 * 1by10.c
 * Dividing 1.0 by 10.0 (floating point) shows the result:
 *  0.100000000000000005551115123126
 * clearly demonstrating how the number of digits of precision matters!
 * (Here, the 55111... portion begins after 18 digits! If the register holding
 * the result is smaller, it gets truncated. With something like a missile
 * tracking system, this truncation can be quite literally fatal! ...As was the
 * case with the Patriot Scud-missile-killer in the Gulf War in 1991, when it missed).
