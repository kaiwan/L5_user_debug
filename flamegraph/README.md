CPU FlameGraphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most
frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. They can be
generated using Brendan Gregg's open source programs on
github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

For the developer's convenience, we provide a wrapper to generate CPU FlameGraphs.
Run the flame_grapher.sh script, follow instructions.
The result is a rendered SVG file - the FlameGraph!
You can view it in a web browser.

The *style* of the flamegraph can be one of:
- regular: 'upward-growing' [the default], or
- icicle : 'downward-growing'
You can change it by editing the script:
flame_grapher.sh:STYLE_INVERTED_ICICLE=0  to the value 1.

=========
IMP NOTE
=========
Getting a decent FlameGraph REQUIRES:
- Frame Pointers (-fomit-frame-pointer is the typical GCC flag!
    Use the -fno-omit-frame-pointer in your build; it doesn't guarantee FP's
    are used though..
  - Possible exception case is the Linux kernel itself; it has intelligent
    algorithms to emit an accurate stack trace even in the absence of frame pointers
  - Symbols (can use a separate symbol file)


===============
Known Issues
===============
I came across this issue when the (orig) flamegraph Perl script on an Aarch64
Yocto-based custom embedded Linux..:
...
Can't locate open.pm in @INC (you may need to install the open module) (@INC entries checked: /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.38.2/aarch64-linux /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.38.2 ...

Brendan Gregg comments upon this very issue here:
https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/issues/245

The QUICK workaround:
simply comment out this line in the original flamegraph.pl Perl script file:
use open qw(:std :utf8);

The dependency then disappears & it still works (albeit without UTF8)..


==================
Example sessions:
==================

$ ./flame_grapher.sh 
Usage: flame_grapher.sh -o svg-out-filename(without .svg) [options ...]
  -o svg-out-filename(without .svg) : name of SVG file to generate (saved under /tmp/flamegraphs/)
Optional switches:
 [-p PID]     : PID = generate a FlameGraph for ONLY this process or thread
                 If not passed, the *entire system* is sampled...
 [-s <style>] : normal = draw the stack frames growing upward   [default]
                icicle = draw the stack frames growing downward
 [-t <type>]  : graph  = produce a flame graph (X axis is NOT time, merges stacks) [default]
                   Good for performance outliers (who's eating CPU? using max stack?); works well for multi-threaded apps
                chart  = produce a flame chart (sort by time, do not merge stacks)
                   Good for seeing all calls; works well for single-threaded apps
 [-f <freq>]  : frequency (HZ) to have perf sample the system/process at [default=99]
                      Too high a value here can cause issues
 -h|-?        : show this help screen.

Note that the FlameGraph SVG (and perf.data file) are stored in the volatile /tmp/flamegraphs dir;
copy them to a non-volatile location to save them.
