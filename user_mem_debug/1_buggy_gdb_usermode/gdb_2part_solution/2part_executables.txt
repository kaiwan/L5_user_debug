man strip

...
 --only-keep-debug
          Strip a file, emptying the contents of any sections that would not be stripped by
 --strip-debug and leaving the debugging sections intact.  In ELF files, this
 preserves all the note sections in the output as well.

           Note - the section headers of the stripped sections are preserved, including their sizes, but the contents of the section are discarded.  The section headers are
preserved so that other tools can match up the debuginfo file with the real
executable, even if that executable has been relocated to a different address
space.

           The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with
          --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part executable.  One a stripped binary which
           will occupy less space in RAM and in a distribution and the second a debugging
           information file which is only needed if debugging abilities are required.

 You could instead do this:

           1.<Link the executable as normal.>
           1.<Copy "foo" to "foo.full">
           1.<Run "strip --strip-debug foo">
           1.<Run "objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo">

           i.e., the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can be the full executable.
           It does not have to be a file created by the --only-keep-debug switch.
